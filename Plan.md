# Portfolio Website Development Plan

This document outlines a detailed, step-by-step development plan for building a modern, professional portfolio website. The plan is designed to be broken down into micro tasks that developers can tackle incrementally. It incorporates core features from Phase 1 while building in flexibility for future enhancements.

---

## Overview

- **Framework:** Next.js (with static site generation)  
- **Language:** TypeScript (integrated from the start)  
- **Content:** MDX for blog posts and project content  
- **Styling:** CSS framework (Tailwind CSS recommended) with a dark/light theme toggle  
- **State Management:** React Context for theme switching  
- **Core Focus:** Accessible, SEO-friendly (basic), responsive design targeting a Product Manager role  
- **Deployment:** Recommended hosting on Vercel (or Netlify) with custom domain configuration via GoDaddy

## Micro Tasks & Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Initialization & Setup

- **[ ] Initialize Project with Next.js and TypeScript**
  - Run: `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`
  - Push initial commit to Git repository (GitHub/GitLab)
  - Establish branch structure (e.g., main and develop branches)

- **[ ] Setup Folder Structure**
  - `/pages` – For route-based page components
  - `/components` – For reusable UI components (navbar, footer, theme toggle, etc.)
  - `/styles` – For global styles and theming configuration
  - `/content` – For MDX files (blog posts, project descriptions)

- **[ ] Configure TypeScript**
  - Review and adjust `tsconfig.json` as necessary
  - Install any needed TypeScript types for libraries

---

### 2. Integrate MDX for Content Management

- **[ ] Install MDX Packages**
  - Install `@next/mdx` and `@mdx-js/loader`
  
- **[ ] Update Next.js Configuration**
  - Modify `next.config.js` to support MDX:
    ```js
    const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
      extension: /\.mdx?$/,
    });
    module.exports = withMDX({
      pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
    });
    ```
    
- **[ ] Create Sample MDX File**
  - Place a sample MDX file in `/content` to test integration and ensure MDX is processing correctly

---

### 3. Theming & Global State with React Context

- **[ ] Create a ThemeContext**
  - Define a React Context to manage theme state (dark/light mode)
  - Provide a default state and a toggle function

- **[ ] Build a Theme Toggle Component**
  - Create a simple button/component to switch themes
  - Ensure the component updates global CSS variables or Tailwind CSS classes accordingly

- **[ ] Update Global Styles**
  - Set up CSS variables or Tailwind configuration to handle theming
  - Ensure all components reference these variables for colors, backgrounds, etc.

---

### 4. Design, Styling & Accessibility

- **[ ] Finalize Design System**
  - Define color palette, typography, spacing, and layout based on a modern, sleek, and professional style
  - Document design guidelines for consistent usage across the site

- **[ ] Implement Global Navigation**
  - Build a sticky navbar containing links to:
    - Home, About, Experience/Portfolio, Contact (Phase 1)
  - Ensure responsiveness and smooth transitions between pages

- **[ ] Add Basic Loading States & Transitions**
  - Implement CSS or React-based transitions for page changes and component loading states

- **[ ] Accessibility Enhancements**
  - Add ARIA labels to interactive elements (buttons, form controls, etc.)
  - Ensure keyboard navigation works across all components
  - Verify color contrast meets accessibility standards

---

### 5. Core Page Development (Phase 1)

#### Home / Landing Page
- **[ ] Build Hero Section**
  - Add a headline, subtext, and a clear call-to-action (e.g., “View Portfolio”)
- **[ ] Implement Sticky Navbar**
  - Ensure consistent navigation across all pages

#### About Me Page
- **[ ] Develop About Me Content**
  - Include professional background, resume highlights, and a personal summary
  - Use semantic HTML (headings, sections) for structure and accessibility

#### Experience & Portfolio Page
- **[ ] List Projects and Roles**
  - Use MDX files to document individual projects, incorporating structured metadata (e.g., technologies used, dates, links)
  - If needed, create dynamic pages for each project

#### Contact Page
- **[ ] Create a Simple Contact Form or Email Link**
  - Ensure form accessibility and basic validation
  - Optionally, integrate a service like Formspree if backend handling is not required

---

### 6. SEO & Basic Meta Configuration

- **[ ] Setup Basic SEO**
  - Install and configure `next-seo` or similar library
  - Add meta tags (title, description, open graph) in `_app.tsx` or `_document.tsx`

- **[ ] Include Sitemap & Robots.txt (Optional for Future)**
  - Generate and maintain a sitemap if public discovery becomes important

---

### 7. Error Tracking & Performance Optimization

- **[ ] Integrate Sentry for Error Tracking**
  - Install Sentry SDK and configure with your Next.js project
  - Ensure error reporting is active in both development and production environments

- **[ ] Configure CI/CD Pipeline**
  - Set up GitHub Actions (or similar) to run automated Lighthouse scoring
  - Include tests for performance regressions

- **[ ] Set Cache Headers for Static Assets**
  - Confirm that Next.js or your hosting provider (Vercel/Netlify) applies proper cache-control headers

- **[ ] Research and Setup Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**
  - Plan ISR usage for blog posts if content updates become frequent

---

### 8. Deployment & Hosting

- **[ ] Choose a Hosting Platform**
  - Recommended: Vercel (or Netlify) for seamless integration with Next.js
- **[ ] Set Up Hosting**
  - Connect your GitHub repository to the hosting platform
  - Configure automatic deployments on push
- **[ ] Domain & SSL Configuration**
  - Update GoDaddy DNS settings to point to your hosting provider
  - Ensure an active SSL certificate (typically provided free on Vercel/Netlify)
- **[ ] Post-Deployment Testing**
  - Verify live site functionality (links, forms, responsiveness, theming)
  - Monitor error logs and performance metrics

---

### 9. Documentation & Future Enhancements

- **[ ] Create Developer Documentation**
  - Document project structure, coding standards, and setup instructions for future developers
- **[ ] Plan for Phase 2 Enhancements**
  - Blog / Articles, Volunteer & Community, Hobbies, Testimonials
  - Consider RSS feed for blog, automated social feed integrations, and further interactive elements

- **[ ] Schedule Regular Reviews**
  - Plan quarterly updates for content and potential feature additions
  - Document any technical debt or future improvements identified during reviews

## Conclusion & Next Steps

This plan is structured to allow incremental updates and iterative development while building a robust, accessible, and maintainable portfolio website. By following these micro tasks, developers can implement key features one step at a time, ensuring each part of the site meets the necessary quality standards before moving to the next.

Once these micro tasks are executed, Phase 1 of the portfolio will be complete, with a solid foundation to build upon for future enhancements.

Let's begin with the initial project setup and integration of core technologies, then proceed through the micro tasks outlined above.
