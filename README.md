# Will McArthur's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, created entirely using [Windsurf](https://windsurf.io), the world's first agentic IDE. The site showcases my experience as a Product Manager, featuring my work on AI-powered products and various technical initiatives.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Styling
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type safety

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Created with Windsurf

This entire project, including all components, pages, and styling, was created through natural language conversations in Windsurf. The AI-powered development environment enabled rapid prototyping and implementation of the portfolio site.
